# Creating a widget

1. choose a `widget-name` with lowercase and separated with a dash ('-') if multiword and create a folder with the same name

        mkdir your-widget

2. run `./update-partial-includes.sh` to refresh `ractive-partials.ls` and `ractive-partials.jade`
3. Edit your files' contents accordingly.
4. Test your widget.

# Testing Widget

1. Place your widget into `scada-drawing-area`, as in the `demos-showcase.jade` page.
2. Your widget SHOULD be resizable.
3. Your widget SHOULD be draggable.


# Naming Conventions

1. Parent CSS class in HTML SHOULD use the same `widget-name`

        <div class="your-widget ...

2. Consequently, your jQuery loop SHOULD use the same `widget-name`

        RactivePartial! .register[-for-document-ready] ->
          $ \your-widget .each ->
            # initialize your widget
            ...


# Special pin names:

1. `online-users`: current online user count
